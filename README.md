# Image locators, keyboard navigation and OCR (optical character recognition)

This project contains two robots that create new robots(!) using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

One robot uses image locators - basically screenshots of the UI elements - to find things to click on. The other use keyboard navigation. Both robots use OCR to find text on the screen.
