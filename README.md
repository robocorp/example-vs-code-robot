# Image locators, keyboard navigation and OCR (optical character recognition)

This project contains two robots that create new robots(!) using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

One robot uses image locators - basically screenshots of the UI elements - to find things to click on. The other use keyboard navigation. Both robots use OCR to find text on the screen.

## Assumptions

These robots assume at least the following conditions:

- Operating system = Windows.
- VS Code welcome screen is enabled.
- VS Code dark theme is enabled.
- Resolution = 1920 x 1080 pixels.
- Text scaling = 150%.
